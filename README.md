# Hi, I'm arn-c0de 👋

Developer focused on embedded systems, security research, and backend development.

## About Me

I'm currently learning and building across various projects—some public here on GitHub, others private or collaborative. My primary focus areas are **Kotlin**, **Python**, and **C**, with particular interest in ESP32 development, SDR radio, and Wi-Fi security tooling.

Looking ahead, I'm planning to expand into **C/C++** for Windows UI and low-level programming, as well as **Rust**.

I'm always open to collaboration and value thoughtful discussions, fresh ideas, and different perspectives. Since I'm actively learning security, mistakes are part of the process—reporting issues and security flaws is welcome and encouraged.

Feel free to reach out with questions or just to chat.
