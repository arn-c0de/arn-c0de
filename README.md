# Hi, I'm arn-c0de 👋

Developer from **Germany** 🇩🇪 with a focus on embedded systems, security research, and backend development.

**Languages:** German (native) · English (fluent)

## About Me

I'm a hands-on developer working across multiple projects—some public on GitHub, others private or in collaboration. I work mainly with **Kotlin**, **Python**, and **C**, with a focus on ESP32 development, SDR radio, and Wi-Fi security tools.

Currently expanding into **C/C++** for Windows UI and low-level programming, as well as **Rust**.

I value collaboration, open exchange of ideas, and continuous learning. As I'm actively developing my security knowledge, I welcome feedback, bug reports, and constructive input.

Always happy to connect—feel free to reach out for questions, collaboration opportunities, or just a chat.
