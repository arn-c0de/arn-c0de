## Hi there 👋

### About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently learning and working on various projects.  
  Some are private GitHub repositories, others are public, and I also collaborate on private repositories.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **Kotlin**, **Python**, and **C** with a focus on **ESP32**, **SDR radio**, and **ESP32 Wi-Fi security tools** (private for now).  
  In the future, I plan to learn **C/C++** for **Windows UI and low-level programming**, as well as **Rust**.

- 🤝 I’m open to collaborating on a wide range of projects.

- 🤔 I value issue discussions, new ideas, and different perspectives.  
  I’m currently learning security, so mistakes may happen — reporting issues and security flaws is welcome and encouraged.

- 💬 Feel free to ask me anything. I’m always open to discussion.
